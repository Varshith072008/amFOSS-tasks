# amFOSS Tasks - Praveshan 2025

## About Me
Hi, I am Maddula Varshith. I just joined my first year of engineering at **Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham** in the **ECE branch**. My interest is in both electronics and computers, which is why I chose this branch. I like to learn new things and build projects.

## Why should we choose you?
You should choose me because I am ready to put in effort and keep learning. I enjoy solving problems and trying new ideas. Even if I donâ€™t know something, I try to understand it step by step. I believe joining amFOSS will push me to grow my skills and work with people who are also passionate about technology.

## How do you intend to contribute back to the club?
I will share whatever I learn with juniors and help them when they are stuck. I will also contribute to projects, hackathons, and open-source work that can add value to the club. Later, when I gain more experience, I would like to mentor new students and make their journey smoother.

## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?
My fields of interest are in both **electronics** and **computers**.  

- **Web Development**: I want to learn both frontend and backend and make real projects that solve problems.  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: I want to understand how machines can learn and make smart decisions. I will start with small projects and later move to advanced ones.  

I want to work on these by practicing, building projects, and learning from the club seniors. I am also very eager to join amFOSS because it is the only club I strongly wish to be part of.
